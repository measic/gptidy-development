This method maps the continuous fluid dynamics problem onto a discrete Cartesian grid where populations of fictitious populations stream (move from point to point) and collide (intereact and exchange particles). Each population of particles moves at a distinct speed: for instance, there is one population of particles moving one grid point East each turn, and another moving one grid point North-West.\n", "\n", "In this chapter, we will describe the test driven implementation of a Lattice-Boltzmann code simulation in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). We will put special emphasis on two approaches for designing tests. In practice, both of these approaches have a common goal; it is to simplify how we think about a piece of code, in order to create simple and efficient tests.\n", "\n", "- *Mechanical* tests that simply check a function does what it does, without any regards or care for actual physics. The code to test is a transparent box with its inside mechanics visible. However, its input and output need not be physically meaningful (during testing), as long as the internal mechanics get exercised the same way. This may mean that we will substitute real numbers with dummy integers in order to avoid pesky floating point comparisons. Or we may substitute pieces of the internals with dummy agents: we care that internal function X gets called twice and that its arguments are such and such according to the flow of data within a piece of code, but we often may not care whether function X does anything! (Why? Most likely because the real function X is tested elsewhere).\n", "- *Domain-area* tests that try and implement specific situations with known outcomes from the domain-area of the code, namely physics here. The code to test is a black box that is fed physical inputs, and thanks to whichever wizard with whatever magic, outputs more physics. In that case, we will often try and reproduce expected behaviours rather than reproduce absolute numbers; e.g. what happens to the velocity when the pressure is doubled, or the size of the pipe halved. Going after specific behaviours is often conceptually simpler that attempting to check that every aspect of the state of a simulation is correct.\n", "\n", "The code used throughout the chapter is based on\n", "[LatBo.jl](https://github.com/UCL/LatBo.jl).

Designing a test can be difficult. That's why the main trick we've tried to illustrate is to start small. Check that one-line function, make sure it is correct, and lock down its behaviour so that you will get a fair warning if it changes in the future. If we had to write one of those _top ten tricks to spend less-time coding and more time on the beach_, unit-testing would occupy the first twenty slots. The second trick is the pivot: to take a step back from the algorithm and try and view it from a different angle. A physical property - `momentum` - has now become a mathematical object - a sum over a series. Or the physical flow between two plates is reduced to a function linear in one variable and quadratic in the other.  Eventually, it all comes down to one single piece of advice: keep your code and tests simple. If a piece of code becomes to large and to tangled to make sense of in a simple test, then it is probably a better way to go about it.
