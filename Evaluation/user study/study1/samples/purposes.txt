The purpose of this project is to explore and experiment with AI/ML/DL techniques and components, such as data extraction, ETL, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and app development, in order to learn and master these technologies.
The project aims to analyze the relationship between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools, with the goal of determining if the SAT is a fair test by comparing performance across different racial groups, income levels, and genders. The project will combine multiple data sets, including SAT scores, school attendance, class size, AP test results, graduation outcomes, demographics, and school surveys, to create a comprehensive analysis.
The project, named "AJNA," aims to apply computer vision and machine learning to customs surveillance and enforcement. It consists of several modules that focus on different aspects such as image acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. The project includes documentation and is designed for development and deployment.
The project aims to provide an open source software library, TensorFlow, for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It allows users to deploy computation on CPUs or GPUs in various devices without having to rewrite code.
The project aims to complete two exercises for the Amadeus challenge, solving a lack of computing capacity by obtaining the number of rows and addressing issues with installing Geobases or Neobase to obtain airport names programmatically.
The project aims to train a deep neural network to classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. The goal is to explore the dataset, design and train a model architecture, make predictions on new images, analyze softmax probabilities, and provide a written report summarizing the results.
The Machine Learning Specialization project on GitHub aims to provide datasets and references for courses related to machine learning.
The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of notebooks that guide users through the typical machine learning (ML) lifecycle, from data cleaning to model hosting, using Amazon SageMaker. It aims to help users understand and implement the various stages of the ML lifecycle in a practical and hands-on manner.
The purpose of this project is to develop a technique for learning discriminative audio features for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) using auto-encoders that make use of data structures and graphs to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
The purpose of this project is to provide an open source software library called TensorFlow, which allows users to perform numerical computation using data flow graphs. The project aims to enable deployment of computation to CPUs, GPUs, desktops, servers, and mobile devices without the need for rewriting code, and also includes a data visualization toolkit called TensorBoard.
