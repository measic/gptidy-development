## Explanation
The code cell is fitting an XGBoost regression model to the training data and using it to make predictions on the test data. The model is then evaluating the performance by calculating the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## Reasoning
This code cell is directly linked to the project's purpose of building a random forest regression model to predict house prices. XGBoost is a popular machine learning algorithm that can handle both regression and classification problems. By fitting an XGBoost regression model to the training data and evaluating its performance on the test data, the code is an essential component of building and improving upon the baseline models.

## Output
The output of this code cell displays the evaluation metrics of the XGBoost regression model. The mean squared error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between the predicted house prices and the actual house prices. The root mean squared error (RMSE) is the square root of the MSE, providing a more interpretable measure of the error. The R-squared (R2) score represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable (house prices) that can be explained by the predictor variables. A higher RMSE and lower R2 score indicate poorer model performance, while a lower RMSE and higher R2 score indicate better performance. In this case, the XGBoost regression model has achieved an RMSE of 25495.90 and an R2 score of 0.915, indicating relatively good performance in predicting house prices.
