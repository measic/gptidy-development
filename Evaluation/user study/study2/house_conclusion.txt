## Summary
This Jupyter Notebook aimed to predict house prices using random forest regression. The dataset was read using Pandas and preprocessed by handling null values and filling missing values. Categorical data was encoded using ordinal encoding. Data visualization techniques such as correlation matrix and histograms were used to analyze the data. Highly correlated features with the sale price were identified and analyzed. The data was then split into training and testing sets, and an XGBoost regression model was built and used to make predictions.

## Interpretation
The analysis of the dataset and the XGBoost regression model provided valuable insights into predicting house prices. The correlation matrix and histograms helped identify the key features that have a significant influence on the sale price. The highly correlated features, such as OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, ExterQual, and GarageArea, were found to have a strong impact on the sale price. The XGBoost regression model achieved good performance, as evidenced by the low mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values, as well as a high R-squared (R2) score. This indicates that the model is able to accurately predict house prices based on the given features. Therefore, this notebook successfully achieved its goal of predicting house prices and improving upon the baseline models.
