## Explanation
The code cell defines a function called `plot_confusion_matrix` that takes in a confusion matrix, a list of classes, and some optional parameters. This function is used to print and plot the confusion matrix, which is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It shows the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the model.

## Reasoning
The `plot_confusion_matrix` function is essential for evaluating the performance of the Logistic Regression model trained in the previous cell. By visualizing the confusion matrix, we can see how well the model predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on their characteristics. This information is critical for understanding the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the model, which are used for further evaluation and comparison with alternative models.

## Output
The output of the code cell is the confusion matrix itself, represented as a 2D array. In this case, the confusion matrix is:
```
[[243  99]
 [ 80 469]]
```
This means that the model correctly predicted 243 passengers as survivors and 469 passengers as non-survivors. However, it incorrectly predicted 99 passengers as non-survivors when they actually survived and 80 passengers as survivors when they did not survive. This information can be used to evaluate the model's performance and identify any patterns or biases in its predictions.
