# The three players' heights, in meters:
klay =  2.01 # Klay Thompson is 6'7"
steph = 1.91 # Steph Curry is 6'3"
kevin = 2.06 # Kevin Durant is officially 6'9", but many suspect that he is taller.
             # (Further complicating matters, membership of the "Splash Triplets" 
             #  is disputed, since it was originally used in reference to 
             #  Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, and Draymond Green.)

# We'd like to look at all 3 pairs of heights, compute the absolute
# difference between each pair, and then find the smallest of those
# 3 absolute differences.  This is left to you!  If you're stuck,
# try computing the value for each step of the process (like the
# difference between Klay's heigh and Steph's height) on a separate
# line and giving it a name (like klay_steph_height_diff).
