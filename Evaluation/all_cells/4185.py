# First, we've written down the values of the 3 universal
# constants that show up in Newton's formula.

# G, the universal constant measuring the strength of gravity.
gravity_constant = 6.674 * 10**-11

# M, the moon's mass, in kilograms.
moon_mass_kg = 7.34767309 * 10**22

# R, the radius of the moon, in meters.
moon_radius_m = 1.737 * 10**6

# The distance the hammer should have fallen over the
# duration of the fall, in meters, according to Newton's
# law of gravity.  The text above describes the formula
# for this distance given by Newton's law.

# Here we've computed the difference between the predicted

# If you've filled in the above code, this should just work.
