variable_def = 'Take this kiss upon the brow!\nAnd, in parting from you now,\nThus much let me avow —\nYou are not wrong, who deem\nThat my days have been a dream;\nYet if hope has flown away\nIn a night, or in a day,\nIn a vision, or in none,\nIs it therefore the less gone?  \nAll that we see or seem\nIs but a dream within a dream.\n\nI stand amid the roar\nOf a surf-tormented shore,\nAnd I hold within my hand\nGrains of the golden sand —\nHow few! yet how they creep\nThrough my fingers to the deep,\nWhile I weep — while I weep!\nO God! Can I not grasp \nThem with a tighter clasp?\nO God! can I not save\nOne from the pitiless wave?\nIs all that we see or seem\nBut a dream within a dream?'
