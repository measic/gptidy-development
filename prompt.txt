Removed unused function declarations in this code. First, identify which functions are unused. Then, remove these from the code. Return the updated code. ```question_overlap = []
terms_used = set()
def reappearance(item):
        if item in terms_used:
            return 1
        else:
            terms_used.add(item)
            return 0
for i, row in jeopardy.iterrows():
        split_question = row["clean_question"].split(" ")
        split_question = [q for q in split_question if len(q) > 5]

            punctuation = ["'", ",", ":", ";", ".", "?"]
            for p in punctuation:
                word = word.replace(p, "")
            return word
